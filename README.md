Game title: The Word Learning Game

Overview:
My game allows young children to learn while having fun. The game offers three different ways of answering each slightly more challenging than the other. The first is selection, the second is drag and drop,
and the third it typed. The word will be spoken to them when they click the speaker icon on the screen. This game has three levels with increasing difficulty and each level has three stages. 

Extending this game:
This game can be extended by changing the words used and the audio files. These can be found in data/dictionary.js. The audio can be found in the sounds folder.
